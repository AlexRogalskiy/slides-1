== Getting started

=== Basic commands

Initialize:

* `git init`
* open second terminal in `.git`, run `tree`

First commit:

* create, stage, commit `README.md`
* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
* in `.git`, run `tree`, show `objects`
* `cat HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/master`
* `git cat-file -p` the commit, tree, and README
* point out that folder and file names are not determined by blob

Second commit:

* create, stage, commit `LICENSE.md`
* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
* in `.git`, run `tree`, show `objects`
* `cat HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/master`
* `git cat-file -p` the new commit, tree, LICENSE
* point out that README is references with same hash

Third commit:

* edit, stage with `--patch`, commit `README.md`
* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
* in `.git`, run `tree`, show `objects`
* identify commit hash on command line
* `git cat-file -p` the new commit, tree, and README
* point out that README is stored again with new text
* point out that LICENSE is references with same hash
* `git cat-file -p` the old README
* point out that both versions are stored

Remove and rename files.

=== Undoing changes

Make changes, undo them with:

* `git checkout`
* `git reset --hard`
* `git clean`

=== Ignoring changes

Create `.gitignore` and matching files.

=== Interacting with remotes

Clone a repo:

* create repo in GitLab, initialize with README and license
* `git clone` it
* show same commits in UI and on command line
* `git remote -v`
* make and push changes
* show changes in GitLab

Add a repo:

* create empty repo in GitLab
* `git remote add` in existing demo repo
* push changes
* show changes in GitLab

Pull changes:

* make changes in GitLab and show new commit
* pull changes

Explain why Git's model requires pull, then push.


== Branching & Merging

=== Branching

* show output of `git branch`
* `git checkout` an old commit
* make new commit
* show output of `git branch`
* show content of `.git/HEAD` and `.git/refs/heads`

=== Branches

* `git branch` for current commit
* show output of `git branch`
* show content of `.git/HEAD` and `.git/refs/heads`

=== Handling branches

* `git branch` to see local branches
* `git branch -vv` to see local branches with more info
* `git branch -a $branch` to see all branches
* `git branch -d $branch` to delete merged branch
* `git branch -D $branch` to delete branch
* `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all` +
to see log with branches

=== Merges

Fast forward:

* create a branch, make a few commits
* `git log`
* check out `master`
* merge fast-forward
* `git log`

Merge commit:

* create a branch, make a few commits
* `git log`
* check out `master`, make commits
* merge
* `git log`, `git look`

== Rebasing

=== Replaying a branch

Prepare:

* create a branch, make a few commits
* `git log`
* check out `master`, make a few commits
* `git log`

Rebase:

* on branch, `git rebase master`
* show that old commits still exit
* `git reset --hard $old-commit`
* `git reset --hard $new-commit`

Prepare with conflict:

* on branch, make a few commits
* check out `master`, make a few commits *with conflict*

Rebase:

* on branch, `git rebase master`
* show conflict resolution
* show `git rebase --abort`

=== Editing commits

* create a branch, make a few commits
* `git log`
* `git rebase -i $commit`
* explain a few options
