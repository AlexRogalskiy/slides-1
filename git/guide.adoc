* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
* in `.git`, run `tree`, show `objects`
* `cat HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/master`
* `git cat-file -p` the commit, tree, and README
* point out that folder and file names are not determined by blob

Second commit:

* create, stage, commit `LICENSE.md`
* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`

* point out that README is references with same hash

Third commit:

* edit, stage with `--patch`, commit `README.md`
* use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
* in `.git`, run `tree`, show `objects`
* identify commit hash on command line
* `git cat-file -p` the new commit, tree, and README
* point out that README is stored again with new text
* point out that LICENSE is references with same hash

Remove and rename files.

=== Undoing changes

Make changes, undo them with:

* `git checkout`
* `git reset --hard`
* `git clean`

=== Ignoring changes

Create `.gitignore` and matching files.

=== Interacting with remotes

Clone a repo:

* create repo in GitLab, initialize with README and license
* `git clone` it
* show same commits in UI and on command line
* `git remote -v`
* make and push changes
* show changes in GitLab

Add a repo:

* create empty repo in GitLab
* `git remote add` in existing demo repo
* push changes
* show changes in GitLab

Pull changes:

* make changes in GitLab and show new commit
* pull changes

Explain why Git's model requires pull, then push.
