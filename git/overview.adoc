== Not your father's VCS

Forget other version control systems (VCS)!

Git has...

* repositories
* `add`, `checkout`, `commit`
* branches, merges

...but they don't mean +
what you think they do.

Here's how Git is different.

=== Changes vs snapshots

Many VCS operate on changes:

=== Changes vs snapshots

Git operates on snapshots:

=== Changes vs snapshots

*Each commit references +
all files and folders!*

Consequence for file moves:

* are not tracked, essentially `delete + add`
* computes similarity to reconstruct moves

=== (De)Centralized

Many VCS need a central repository to

* see the history
* checkout commits
* create commits

Git creates a +
*local, self-sufficient* +
copy of the repo!

=== Git's folder

Local `.git` folder contains:

* all files and folders ever committed
* all commits, branches, and messages

(More on that later.)

=== Everything's local

Local operations are fast, e.g.:

* checking out a commit
* looking at the log
* creating a commit
* creating a branch

Interaction with remotes +
though `pull` and `push`.

=== 5 > 2

Many VCS have two stages:

* checked-out files
* remote repository

Git has five:

* working tree
* stash
* index / staging
* local repository
* remote repository

=== 5 stages

working tree:: plain files that you change
stash:: park changes for a moment
index / stage:: the parts of your changes you want to commit
local repository:: the committed snapshots
remote repository:: push and pull snapshots

=== Basic workflow

* pull remote changes into working tree
* edit working tree
* stage selected changes to index
* commit index to local repository
* push commits to remote repository

=== Commits

Git's commits:

* know their parents
* are immutable, even if local
* can be "edited and rearranged" +
(new commits are created)

=== Everything's safe

* common Git operations +
don't delete data
* once it's in `.git`, it's safe!
* just need to find a way +
to get it back out
