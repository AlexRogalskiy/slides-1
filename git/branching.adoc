== Branching & Merging

=== Branching

* branching occurs when two commits +
have the same parent
* a _branch_ is just a pointer to a commit

=== Branches

* `git branch $name` creates a new branch
* `git checkout $branch` to check out branch
* `git checkout -b $name` is 2-in-1: +
creates and checks out

=== Handling branches

* `git branch` to see local branches
* `git branch --no-merged` to see unmerged branches
* `git branch -vv` to see local branches with more info
* `git branch -d $branch` to delete merged branch
* `git branch -D $branch` to delete branch
* `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all` +
to see log with branches

=== Merges

A _merge_ brings commits +
from one branch into another:

* `git merge` merges named branch +
into current branch

Two possible results:

* can be _fast-forward_ if named branch +
contains all commits of current branch
* can create a merge commit +
("just" a commit with two parents)
