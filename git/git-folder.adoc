== Git's innards

What follows are _not basics_! +
Few Git users know them.

*But*:

* I wish I knew them earlier
* makes Git less magic
* makes Git more predictable

=== Git's folder

Local `.git` folder contains:

* all files and folders ever committed
* all commits and messages

How?

=== Git's folder

Some files and folders in `.git`:

[source,none]
----
.git
├── HEAD    // points to current commit
├── config  // repo configuration
├── index   // captures all tracked files
├── logs    // history of branch HEADs
├── objects // hashed blobs of all files
└── refs    // HEADs for current branch
----

=== Key-value store

Git uses `.git/objects` as key-value store.

Given an object (e.g. file or text):

* uses SHA-1 to generate a 40 char hash
* compresses object to binary blob
* stores blob under hash

=== Key-value store

Hash is split:

* first 2 chars become folder name
* last 38 chats become file name

[source,none]

The file is the binary blob.

=== Objects

All these are objects:

* files
* folders / trees
* commits

=== Files

. compressed to blobs
. stored under their hash in `.git/objects`

=== Folders / trees

. turned into files:
+
[source]
----

=== Branches and Tags

Branches and tags:

* are turned into files +
containing a commit hash
* stored in `.git/refs/heads` +
or `.git/refs/tags`

That's why branches are free!

=== HEAD

`HEAD` reflects checked out commit.

It's a file `.git/HEAD` that contains _either_:

* name of current branch _or_
* hash of current commit +
if not on a branch +
(called _detached HEAD_)

=== Making a new commit

. build tree for root folder:
** reference unchanged files/trees
** create new objects were needed
. point branch indicated by `HEAD` to new tree

=== Checking out a commit

. find commit in `.git/objects`
. to rebuild working tree:
** walk hashed objects
** uncompress blobs
. update `HEAD` to commit +
(now detached)

=== Checking out a branch

. find branch in `.git/refs/heads`
. find indicated commit in `.git/objects`
. to rebuild working tree:
** walk hashed objects
** uncompress blobs
. update `HEAD` to branch
