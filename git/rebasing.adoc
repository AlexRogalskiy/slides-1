=== Too many merges

So far:

* whether working on `master` or a branch, +
branching will happen all the time
* every merge creates a merge commit:

=== Too many merges

15 developers, pushing twice a day

*30 merge commits a day!*

=== Too many merges

Wouldn't it be nice to edit a commit's parent?

* `C4` had `C2` as _base_ (other word for parent)
* `C4'` is like `C4`, but has new base `C3`
* `C4` was _rebased_

=== Rebasing

While we're editing, why not...

* apply a change elsewhere? +
(e.g. on a different branch)
* edit changes before applying them?
* edit the message?
* split and combine changes?

Rebasing allows all of that!

=== Rebasing

Remember, changes don't get lost:

* commits are _immutable_
* graph of commits is _append-only_

Instead, rebasing...

* creates new commits from existing ones
* points branch to new commits

‚áù Old commits remain available for recovery!

=== Rebase

Two important rebasing use cases:

* replaying a branch on updated master
* editing commits in an unpublished branch

=== Replaying a branch

Situation:

* you are working on a branch
* you want to apply the changes +
to `master` without merging

Solution:

```
git checkout $branch
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge $branch
```

=== Editing commits

Situation:

* you are working on a branch
* you want to clean up the commits +
to prepare them for pushing

Solution:

```
git checkout $branch
git rebase -i $commit
```

(Rebases all commits after `$commit`.)

=== Rebasing

No rebase if working tree has changes: +
`git stash` +
(Later: `git stash pop`)

If a rebase gets out of hand: +
`git rebase --abort`

=== Rebasing

Your turn:

* go to https://learngitbranching.js.org/[learngitbranching.js.org]
* do all exercises up to _A Mixed Bag_

(You don't need to make actual changes; +
just `git commit`.)
