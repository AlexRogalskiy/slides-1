== Git Workflow @ Disy

=== What we don't want

We don't want:

* long-lived branches
* merge commits

=== Configuration

Consequences:

* GitLab was configured to reject new branches
* Git was configured (with `git config`) +
to prevent non-fast-forward merges

=== How to develop

Two possibilities:

* on master
* on local branch

=== Developing on `master`

Working on `master` is simpler:

* commit changes on `master`
* `git pull` was configured +
to rebase your commits
* `git push`

=== Developing on branch

Working on a branch is cleaner:

* commit changes on your `$branch`
* rebase on updated `master`
* fast-forward `master` to `$branch`
* `git push`

=== Developing on branch

Once a branch is done:

* on `master`, `git branch -D $branch`

(This only removes the entry +
in `.git/refs/heads`)

=== Release branches

Default workflow for release branches:

* develop/review on `master`
* apply individual commits to `$release` +
with `git cherry-pick $commit`

=== Your turn
