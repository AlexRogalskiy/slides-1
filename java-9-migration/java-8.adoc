<h3>Building on 8, Running on 9+</h3>
++++

=== Staying On 8

Projects may decide to keep +
Java 8 as baseline.

Still:

* run (nightly?) builds +
  on Java 9+
* find problems early
* avoid dead ends

=== Staying On 8

Some problems may +
prevent building on 9+:

* outdated build tool
* outdated build plugins

Try testing on 9+!

=== Testing On 9+

Essentially:

```sh
# regular Java 8 build
mvn clean install
# on Java 9+:
mvn surefire:test
mvn failsafe:integration-test
```
