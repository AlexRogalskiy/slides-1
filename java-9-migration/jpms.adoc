=== Other Features

* decoupling via services
* finer grained dependencies and exports
* open packages and modules (for reflection)
* unnamed and automatic modules (for migration)
* layers (for containers)
* `jlink` to create runtime images

=== Of Modules And JARs

Modularized JDK and legacy JARs have to cooperate.

Two requirements:

* for the module system to work, +
everything needs to be a module
* for compatibility, the class path +
and regular JARs have to keep working

=== The Unnamed Module

The *Unnamed Module* +
contains _all_ JARs on the class path +
(including modular JARs).

* has no name (surprise!)
* can read all modules
* exports all packages

Inside the unnamed module +
"the chaos of the class path" lives on.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* one unnamed module per class loader
