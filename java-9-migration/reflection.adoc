== Reflective Access

Exporting a package makes it public API:

* modules can compile code against it
* clients expect it to be stable

What if a type is only meant +
to be accessed via reflection?

(Think Spring, Hibernate, etc.)


=== Open Packages

[source,java]
----
module A {
	opens some.pack;
}
----

* at compile time: +
types in `some.pack` are not accessible
* at run time: +
_all_ types and members in `some.pack` +
are accessible


=== Qualified Opens

[source,java]
----
module A {
	opens some.pack to B;
}
----

* same as `opens`, but only _B_ can access


=== Open Modules

[source,java]
----
open module A {
	// no more `opens` directives
}
----

The same as open packages +
but for all of them!
