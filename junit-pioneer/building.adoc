== Building

* quality control
* compatibility
* one-click releases
* website build

=== Build Pipeline

* build project with https://gradle.org/[Gradle] (https://gradle.org/kotlin/[Kotlin style])
* trigger build on commit with https://github.com/features/actions[GitHub Actions]
* kick off release build on GitHub
* trigger website build

=== Quality Control

Code style:

* we want a uniform code style
* we don't want to manually +
  discuss or enforce it

So we let https://github.com/diffplug/spotless[Spotless]
and https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle[Checkstyle] +
break the build on violations.

=== Quality Control

Code quality:

* we want to avoid pitfalls and gotchas
* we want high test coverage
* we know better than any tool üòÅ

We use https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] +
to analyze and report.

=== Version Control

Build against:

* range of operating systems
* range of Java versions
* as module and not
* range of JUnit versions

All with GitHub Actions.

=== Version Control

```sh
# main-build.yml
strategy:
  matrix:
    java: [ 8, 11, 15 ]
    os: [ubuntu, macos]

# junit5-build.yml
strategy:
  matrix:
    junit-version: [ '5.5.0', '5.6.0', ... ]
```

Kicks of Gradle release build.

=== One-Click Releases

In release build, Gradle uses https://github.com/shipkit[Shipkit] to:

* detect next version
* build artifacts
* upload to Bintray (with https://github.com/bintray/gradle-bintray-plugin[Bintray plugin])
* create Git tag
* create GitHub release with changelog
