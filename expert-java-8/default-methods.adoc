=== Isolate From Library

Use FP library of your choice to get functional interfaces that can throw exceptions.
Maybe wrap'em:

```java
public interface CoolLibFunction<T, S> {

	S call(T arg);

}

public interface MyFunction<T, S> extends CoolLibFunction<T, S> {

	@Deprecated
	default S call(T arg) {
		return execute(args);
	}

	S execute(T arg);

}
```

This way it is very unlikely to accidentally rely on `CoolLibFunction::call`
 and it can be exchanged for another lib without breaking your code.
