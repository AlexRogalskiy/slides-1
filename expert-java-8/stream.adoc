* content
** overarching goal: more readable code by using simple building blocks (fuck succinctness)
** utility methods to start streams
** method handles > lambdas & short lambdas > long lambdas
** abstraction
*** higher level than when writing loops
      "see first part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU"
** error handling
** look at reduce more often
** findFirst, findAny vs findOnly
** utility methods for complicated collectors
** performance model
    "second part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU"
*** overheads
*** parallelization
** missing features
