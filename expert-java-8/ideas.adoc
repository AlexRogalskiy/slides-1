* content
** overarching goal: more readable code by using simple building blocks (fuck succinctness)
** utility methods to start streams
** method handles > lambdas & short lambdas > long lambdas
** abstraction
*** higher level than when writing loops; see first part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU
** error handling
** look at reduce more often
** utility methods for complicated collectors
** performance model; see second part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU
*** overheads
*** parallelization
** missing features

* performance

* for exception handling implement method
** that declares the exception of the passed checked function
** transforms to regular function by sneaky throws if exception occurs
** only works if consumer is right were map is called
