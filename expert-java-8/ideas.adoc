Content

* overarching goal: more readable code by using simple building blocks (fuck succinctness)
* utility methods to start streams
* method handles > lambdas & short lambdas > long lambdas
* abstraction
** higher level than when writing loops; see first part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU
* look at reduce more often
* utility methods for complicated collectors
** overheads
** parallelization
* missing features: https://medium.com/@johnmcclean/java-8-streams-10-missing-features-ec82ee90b6c0
* loops grows more easily

Performance

* performance model; see second part of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDplU7mOocU
* my post on stream performance

Exception handling

* new approach:
** that declares the exception of the passed checked function
** transforms to regular function by sneaky throws if exception occurs
** only works if consumer is right were map is called

Use Cases:

* if-empty:
** get Stream
** process stream
** if empty, do X

* do-on-first-roll-back-on-second
** get stream
** do X with first element
** roll X back if second element is found!
** ideally allow to insert that into streams

== Lambdas
