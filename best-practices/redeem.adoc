== Redeeming _best practices_
image::images/chess.jpg[background, size=cover]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* best practices at least work somewhere
* constantly out of my depth; "best practices" are life savers
* if you have little information, skill, and/or time, choosing a best practice is good strategy
* the less you know, the more you should stick to best practices

=== Problems
image::images/locked-gears.png[background, size=contain]

Problems:

* term _best_ practice
* common lack of context
* lacking completeness

[state="gallery left bottom"]
=== Terms
image::images/post-its.jpg[background, size=cover]

Better terms:

* _established practice_
* _known pattern_
* _good default_
* (whatever, really)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* many best practices have value
* other terms foster research and discussion
--

=== Context
image::images/king.jpg[background, size=cover]

Good default...

* ... in `${simplified-context}`
* ... unless `${counter-indicators}`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* problem definition
* actionable steps
* reasonable explanation of causality
* measurements before and after
* trade-offs and limitations
--

=== Judging
image::images/justicia.jpg[background, size=cover]

* context vs unisize
* concrete vs abstract
* measured vs guesswork

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* what problem does it solve
* "it depends" ~> "on what?!"
* concrete practice or amorphous goal
* how to measure success
* document decisions; don't shy away from "because the Internet said so"

* already following a practice?
** adoption is not free!
** how much better do you expect the results to be?

=== Balancing
image::images/balance.jpg[background, size=cover]

Be wary of best practices, +
but look for good defaults.

*Don't NIH!*

Know your limits +
and focus energy +
on your core competency.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* don't NIH
* don't reinvent the wheel (how will your practice differ?)
* if you don't have skills/time to research, best practice is likely best choice (statistically)
