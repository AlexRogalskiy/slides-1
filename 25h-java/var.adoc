== Fun with `var`

=== Intersection Types

=== Motivation

Sometimes you need a type +
that implements two interfaces +
without creating a new interface.

*For example:*

You need something +
that is `Closeable` and an `Iterator` +
without creating `CloseableIterator`.

=== Intersection types

Given two types, the *intersection type* +
is the set of variables that are of both types.

An intersection type has the API of both types!

*For example:*

A variable of type `Closeable & Iterator<E>` +
is both `Closeable` and an `Iterator<E>`.

It has `close()` and `hashNext()`/`next()`

=== Code

=== Intersection types

. in method signatures, express with generics:
+
```java
public <T extends Closeable & Iterator<String>>
	T createCloseableIterator(...) { ... }

public <E, T extends Closeable & Iterator<E>>
	E firstMatch(T elements, ...) { ... }
```
. for variables use `var`:
+
```java
var elements = createCloseableIterator(true);
firstMatch(elements, ...);
```

=== Evaluation

Downsides:

* combination of non-trivial Java features:
** generics with bounded wildcards
** type inference
* refactoring becomes harder

But:

* intersection types are known concept
* can be really helpful in a bind

*Add to tool box; use with care.*

=== Traits

=== Motivation

Sometimes you need to attach +
prepared functionality to an instance +
without creating a new type.

*For example:*

You have a `Megacorp` instance and an +
`IsSuccessful`-interface that you +
want to attach to it.

=== Traits

A *trait* extends an interface +
and implements additional behavior.

The language needs to offer a simple way +
to "attach" that trait to an instance at hand.

=== Code

=== Traits

. create a functional, delegating interface:
+
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MegacorpDelegate extends Megacorp {
	Megacorp delegate();
	// implement `Megacorp` with default methods
	// by forwarding calls to `delegate()`
}
```
. create traits as interfaces:
+
```java
interface IsEvil extends Megacorp {
	default boolean isEvil() { return true; }
}
```

=== Traits

[start=3]
. cast lambda to desired intersection +
and assign to `var`-ed variable:
+
```java
var corp = (MegacorpDelegate & IsEvil) () -> original;
```

=== Evaluation

Downsides:

* combination of non-trivial Java features:
** lambda as poly expression
** type inference
** default methods
* refactoring becomes harder +
(see intersection types)
* delegating interface is cumbersome
* breaks in collections (*!*)

*Never use in "real" code!*

=== Ad-hoc Fields And Methods

=== Motivation

Sometimes you need to extend a type +
with a field or a method.

But not enough to create a new subtype.

Maybe with an anonymous class?

=== Anonymous class

```java
new SimpleMegacorp(...) {
	final BigDecimal SUCCESS_BOUNDARY =
		new BigDecimal("1000000000000");

	boolean isSuccessful() {
		return earnings()
			.compareTo(SUCCESS_BOUNDARY) > 0;
	}
};
```

=== Code

=== Ad-hoc fields & methods

. create anonymous class with +
additional fields and/or methods
. assigned to `var`-ed variable


```java
var corp = new SimpleMegacorp(...) {
	final BigDecimal SUCCESS_BOUNDARY =
		new BigDecimal("1000000000000");

	boolean isSuccessful() {
		return earnings()
			.compareTo(SUCCESS_BOUNDARY) > 0;
	}
};
corp.isSuccessful();
```

=== Evaluation

Downsides:

* anonymous class is verbose (e.g. in stream)
* combination of non-trivial Java features:
** anonymous classes
** type inference
* impedes refactoring (*!*)

*Prefer the alternatives!*

=== Alternatives

Alternatives for ad-hoc fields:

* `Map.Entry`
* tuples from http://www.vavr.io/[Vavr], https://github.com/aol/cyclops[Cyclops], etc.
* records

Alternatives for ad-hoc methods:

* extending base types
* utility methods
* traits
