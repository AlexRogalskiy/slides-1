== Lots to talk about

The plan for today:

* start with a *Java 8* code base
* take it all the way to *Java 14*
* be amazed by how much changes

This talk is:

* a showcase, not a tutorial
* not a complete list

=== Links

* slides at https://slides.codefx.org/[slides.codefx.org]
* code at https://github.com/CodeFX-org[github.com/CodeFx-org]
** demo code base: https://github.com/CodeFX-org/java-after-eight[/java-after-eight]
** more Java 9+ features: https://github.com/CodeFX-org/demo-java-x[/demo-java-x]

// Tweet questions with https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaNext?src=hash[#JavaNext]


== Java 8

* released 03/2014
* free support by Oracle *ended 01/2019*
* free support by Red Hat *until 06/2023*
* more free and commercial support available

=== It's a great release...

* solid feature set
* good performance
* very stable
* occasional backports
* great support

=== ...but it's getting dated

Java 8 misses out on most recent developments:

* many new language features
* many new and improved APIs
* many new JVM features
* improved performance +
  (in certain cases)

=== Time to upgrade

Let me show you how much +
you're missing out on +
if you're still on Java 8.

== Code

Code, code, code, code

(https://github.com/CodeFX-org/java-after-eight[code base])


== Java 9

* released 09/2017
* support *ended 01/2018*

=== What we've seen

* module system | `module-info.java`
* collection factories | `List::of`
* new process API | `ProcessHandle::pid`
* new version API | `Version::major`
* improved streams | `Stream::dropWhile`
* improved `Optional` | `Optional::or`

=== What we haven't seen

* `try` with effectively final resource
* private interface methods
* stack walking API (improves logging perf)
* unified logging
* multi-release JARs
* app/runtime images | `jlink`


== Java 10

* released 03/2018
* support *ended 07/2018*

=== What we've seen

* local-variable type inference | `var tags`
* more collection factories | `Map::copyOf`
* more collectors | `Collectors::toUnmodifiableList`
* application class-data sharing


== Java 11

* released 09/2018
* free support by Oracle *ended 01/2019*
* free support by Red Hat *until 10/2024*
* commercial support available

=== What we've seen

* improved whitespace handling | `String::strip`
* uniform array creation | `toArray(String[]::new)`
* better `Path` creation | `Path::of`
* better `Predicate` negation | `Predicate::not`

=== What we haven't seen

* reactive HTTP/2 API | ↴
+
```java
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .GET()
    .uri(URI.create("http://codefx.org"))
    .header("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5")
    .build();
```
* more `String` improvements | `String::lines`
* easier IO | `Files::readString`
* improved `Optional` | `Optional::isEmpty`
* Java scripts | `java SourceFile.java`


== Java 12

* release 03/2019
* support *ended 07/2019*

=== What we've seen

* more powerful collections | `Collectors::teeing`
* better async error handling | ↴ +
  `CompletableFuture::exceptionallyCompose`
* included JDK CDS archive

=== What we haven't seen

* switch expressions | ↴
+
```java
boolean bool = switch (ternaryBool) {
	case TRUE -> true;
	case FALSE -> false;
	case FILE_NOT_FOUND -> throw
			new FileNotFoundException("🤬");
};
```
* transforming Strings | ↴ +
  `String.transform(Function<String, R>)`
* social media number format | ↴ +
  `NumberFormat::getCompactNumberInstance`
* easy file comparison | `Files::mismatch`


== Java 13

* released 09/2019
* free support *ended 01/2020*
* commercial support available https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/[by Azul]

=== What we've seen

* text blocks | ↴
+
```java
var recommendation = """
		{
			"title": '$TITLE',
			"recommendations": $RECS
		}
	""";
```
* obvious `String` formattting | `String::format`
* automatic application CDS archive


== Java 14

* release 03/2020
* support *ends 07/2020*

=== What we've seen

* records | `record Title(String text)`
* pattern matching | `o instanceof Article a`
* helpful NPE messages

=== What we haven't seen

* standardized foreign-memory access
* JFR event streaming
* OS-specific installers | `jpackage`


== Java 8 to 14

* stronger encapsulation and better services | modules
* safer code | processes, versions, whitespace, etc.
* more expressive code | LOC: 1654 📉 1242
// characters: 58103 📉 47107
* faster code | run time: ~1s 📉 ~ 0.8 ms
* better JVM | MR-JARs, GCs, packaging, monitoring, etc.

*Sure you don't want to upgrade?*
