=== Repeated tests

Ever wanted to run +
the same test 5 times?

No? But now you can:

```java
@RepeatedTest(5)
void againAndAgainAndAgain() { /*...*/ }
```

* annotated method is a container
* each invocation is a test

=== Repeated tests

There isn't much more to it:

* `@DisplayName` defines container name
* `@RepeatedTest(name)` defines test name:
** `{displayName}` (`@RepeatedTest`-'s name)
** `{currentRepetition}`
** `{totalRepetitions}`
* `RepetitionInfo` provides current and +
total repetition count

=== Repeated tests

```java
class RepeatedInvocationTest {
	private static int REPS = 0;

	@DisplayName("Calling repeated...")
	@RepeatedTest(value = 5,
		name = "... {currentRepetition}th"
			"of {totalRepetitions} times")
	void repeated(RepetitionInfo reps) {
		REPS++;
		// getCurrentRepetition starts with 1
		assertEquals(REPS, reps.getCurrentRepetition());
		assertEquals(5, reps.getTotalRepetitions());
	}

}
```
