=== Repeating tests

Ever wanted to run +
the same test 5 times?

* to ferry out concurrency bugs
* to gather performance data

=== Repeated tests

Here's how:

```java
class RepeatedInvocationTest {
	private static int REPS = 0;

	@RepeatedTest(5)
	void repeated(RepetitionInfo reps) {
		REPS++;
		// getCurrentRepetition starts with 1
		assertEquals(REPS, reps.getCurrentRepetition());
		assertEquals(5, reps.getTotalRepetitions());
	}

}
```

=== Full integration

Repeated tests are fully integrated:

* `@RepeatedTest` method is container
* each invocation is a single test
* each test has regular lifecycle:
** `@Before-`/`@AfterEach` are executed
** parameters can be injected +
* repeated and other tests can be mixed

=== Repeated names

Default display names:

* for `@RepeatedTest` container: method name
* for generated tests:
+
```
repetition {currentRepetition} of {totalRepetition}
```

=== Repeated names

Custom display names:

* `@DisplayName` on `@RepeatedTest` +
defines test container name
* `@RepeatedTest(name)` defines +
each test's name
** `{displayName}`: `@RepeatedTest`-'s name
** `{currentRepetition}`
** `{totalRepetitions}`

=== Repeated tests

Custom display names:

```java
class RepeatedInvocationTest {

	@DisplayName("Calling repeated...")
	@RepeatedTest(value = 5,
		name = "... {currentRepetition}th"
			"of {totalRepetitions} times")
	void repeated(RepetitionInfo reps) { /*...*/ }

}
```

=== Repetition Info

To access information about repetitions:

* declare parameter `RepetitionInfo` +
(injected by JUnit)
* query for current and total repetition count

=== Repeated tests
==== Summary

* use `@RepeatedTest(n)` to repeat test `n` times
* configure test names with `name` attribute
* use `RepetitionInfo` to access repetition counts
