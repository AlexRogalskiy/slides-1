== Side by side

{toc}

=== So what about all those JUnit 3/4 tests?

You *don't have to* update them!

Instead run old and new tests side by side.

=== Side by side

Dependencies:

* keep JUnit 3.x or 4.x around
* add Vintage engine:
+
```shell
org.junit.jupiter
junit-vintage-engine
5.2.0
```
* add Jupiter API and engine

Now you can run JUnit 3/4 via JUnit Platform! 👍

=== Side by side

Note:

* old and new APIs use different +
package names, so no conflicts!
* `@Category(Type.class)` becomes +
`@Tag("fully.qualified.name.of.Type")`
* remember to use up-to-date tools:
+
--
** Maven and Gradle run 3/4 via platform 😀
** IntelliJ runs 3/4 via support for 4 😟
--
+
let's hope the discrepancy causes no problems!
