=== JUnit 4 Architecture

* a single JAR (ignoring Hamcrest)
* used by
** developers
** extensions
** IDEs, build-tools
* no separation of concerns


=== JUnit 4 Architecture

* tools provide us with awesome features!
* but API is not powerful enough

=== Dead End

Part of JUnit's success is its great tool support!

But the same tools locked development in.

=== Approach in JUnit 5

Separation of concerns:

. an API to write tests against
. a mechanism to discover and run tests
. an API for tools to run tests


=== Approach in JUnit 5

Separation of concerns V 2.0:

. an API to write tests against
. a mechanism to discover and run tests
[loweralpha]
.. specific engine per variant of tests +
(e.g. JUnit 4 or JUnit 5)
.. orchestration of engines
.. API between them
. an API for tools to run tests


=== Subprojects & Modules

JUnit Jupiter 5.0.0-M4::
* `junit-jupiter-api`
* `junit-jupiter-engine`
JUnit Vintage 4.12.0-M4::
* `junit-vintage-engine`
JUnit Platform 1.0.0-M4::
* `junit-platform-engine`
* `junit-platform-runner`
* a lot more

=== Moar Engines!

* want to run JUnit 4 tests? +
⇝ create an engine for it!
* want TestNG to have support like JUnit? +
⇝ create an engine for it!
* want to write tests in natural language? +
⇝ create an engine for it!

=== Open Platform

Once JUnit 5 adoption sets in:

* tools are decoupled from implementation details
* tools can support all frameworks (almost) equally well
* new frameworks start with full tool support
* developers can try out new things

A new generation of test frameworks might arise!


=== Open Platform

JUnit's success as a platform +
becomes *available to everybody*.

This heralds the +
*next generation of testing on the JVM*!


=== It Already Shows

Some community engines:

* http://jqwik.net/[jqwik]: "a simpler JUnit test engine"
* http://specsy.org/[Specsy]: "a BDD-style unit-level testing framework"
* http://spekframework.org/[Spek]: "a Kotlin specification framework for the JVM"
