== Architecture

{toc}

=== JUnit 4 architecture

* a single JAR (ignoring Hamcrest)
* used by
** developers
** extensions
** IDEs, build-tools
* no separation of concerns

=== JUnit 4 architecture

* tools provide us with awesome features!
* but API is not powerful enough

=== Dead end

Part of JUnit's success is its great tool support!

But the same tools locked development in.

____
The success of JUnit as a platform prevents the development of JUnit as a tool. +

=== Approach in JUnit 5

Separation of concerns:

. an API to write tests against
. a mechanism to discover and run tests
. an API for tools to run tests

=== Approach in JUnit 5

Separation of concerns V 2.0:

. an API to write tests against
. a mechanism to discover and run tests
[loweralpha]
.. specific engine per variant of tests +
(e.g. JUnit 4 or JUnit 5)
.. orchestration of engines
.. API between them
. an API for tools to run tests

=== Subprojects & modules

JUnit Jupiter 5.2.0::
* `junit-jupiter-api`
* `junit-jupiter-params`
* `junit-jupiter-engine`
JUnit Vintage 5.2.0::
* `junit-vintage-engine`
JUnit Platform 1.2.0::
* `junit-platform-engine`
* `junit-platform-runner`

And a lot more...

==== Summary

* clear separation of concerns
* API for developers

=== Moar engines!

* want to run JUnit 4 tests? +
⇝ create an engine for it!
* want TestNG to have support like JUnit? +
⇝ create an engine for it!
* want to write tests in natural language? +
⇝ create an engine for it!

=== Moar engines!

=== Open platform

Now that JUnit 5 adoption sets in:

* tools are decoupled from implementation details
* tools can support all frameworks (almost) equally well
* new frameworks start with full tool support
* developers can try out new things

A new generation of test frameworks might arise!

=== Open platform

JUnit's success as a platform +
becomes *available to everybody*.

This heralds the +
*next generation of testing on the JVM*!

=== It already shows

Some community engines:

* http://jqwik.net/[jqwik]: "a simpler JUnit test engine"
* http://specsy.org/[Specsy]: "a BDD-style unit-level testing framework"
* http://spekframework.org/[Spek]: "a Kotlin specification framework for the JVM"

Other projects:

* https://faustxvi.github.io/junit5-docker/[Docker]: starts and stops docker containers
* https://github.com/kncept/junit-dataprovider[Parameterized]: "similar to TestNG DataProvider"
* https://junit-pioneer.org[JUnit Pioneer]: "JUnit 5 Extension Pack"

=== Pick the right tool...

\... for the right job:

* not all code needs to be tested +
with the same engine
* Jupiter is a great default, but +
specific parts of a code base +
may use hand-picked engines

=== Side benefit

This is great for migration:

* leave JUnit 4 tests untouched
* write new tests against Jupiter
* execute all with one facade: +
JUnit Platform

More on that in a minute.

=== Architecture
==== Summary

* clear separation of concerns: +
APIs for developers, tools, +
and new frameworks
* opens up the platform: +
tool support for everybody!
* enables coexistence of different +
approaches and versions
