=== How I think about Software

* interacting parts
* parts have
** names
** dependencies
** capabilities
* creates a graph

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* helps tools and devs to
** dissect
** analyze
** reason about
** work with
* Maven, jdeps

=== How the JVM thinks about it
image::images/ball-of-mud-2.jpg[background, size=cover]


* parts are packaged as JARs
* to the JVM JARs
** have no names
** dependencies are unexpressed
** have no coherent surface
* JVM rolls them into one big ball of mud

* graph is gone
* "modularity erasure"

=== Consequences

* http://blog.codefx.org/java/jar-hell/[JAR hell]
** unexpressed, transitive dependencies
** shadowing, version conflicts
** complex class loading
* slow
* unsecure
* maintenance nightmare
