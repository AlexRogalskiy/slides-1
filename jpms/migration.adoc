== Migration

++++
<h3>Moving Into Module Land</h3>
++++

=== Why Is It Even An Option?
image::images/keep-out.jpg[background, size=cover]

* most module systems are "in or out", +
* but modularized JDK and legacy JARs +
have to cooperate!
* so migration has to be possible


=== Enablers

Migration is enabled by two features:

* Unnamed Module(s)
* Automatic Modules

And the fact that module and class path coexist:

* modular JARs can be put on either
* "regular" JARs can be put on either


=== The Unnamed Module

++++
<h3>Why The Class Path "Just Works"</h3>
++++


=== Definition

The *Unnamed Module* +
contains _all_ JARs on the class path +
(including modular JARs).

* has no name (surprise!)
* can read all modules
* exports all packages

Inside the unnamed module +
"the chaos of the class path" lives on.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* one unnamed module per class loader
--


=== Example

Put all your JARs on the class path.

=== No Access

* what if your code was modularized? +
and your dependencies were not?
* proper modules can not depend on +
"the chaos on the class path"
* this is not possible:
+
[source,java]
----
module advent {
	requires unnamed;
}
----

=== Automatic Modules

++++
<h3>From Modules To The Class Path</h3>
++++


=== Definition

An *Automatic Module* +
is created _for each_ "regular" JAR +
on the module path.

* gets a name based on the file name or a +
manifest entry `AUTOMATIC-MODULE-NAME`
* can read all modules +
(including the Unnamed Module)
[[TODO, use a diagram that has the automatic module read a dependency from the unnamed module to drive the important point home]]
* exports all packages


=== Example

* put `guava-19.0.jar` on the module path
* then this works:
+
[source,java]
----
module advent {
	requires guava;
}
----

=== Migration Strategies

Three strategies emerge:

* bottom-up migration
* top-down migration
* inside-out migration

=== Bottom-Up Migration

Works best for projects *without* +
unmodularized dependencies +
(libraries).

* turn project JARs into modules
* they still work on the class path
* clients can move them to the module path +
whenever they want


////
=== Bottom-Up Migration

++++
<h3>Example</h3>
++++

[[TODO, diagram]]
////


=== Top-Down Migration

Required for projects *with* +
unmodularized dependencies +
(applications).

* turn project JARs into modules


=== Top-Down Migration

* modularized dependencies:
** require direct ones
** put all on the module path
* unmodularized dependencies:
** require direct ones with automatic name
** put direct ones on the module path
** put others on the class path

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* only required modules are loaded from the module path
* ~> automatic modules' dependencies would not be loaded
* ~> automatic modules' dependencies go on the class path
--


////
=== Top-Down Migration

++++
<h3>Example</h3>
++++

[[TODO, diagram]]
////


=== Top-Down Migration

When dependencies get modularized:

* hopefully the name didn't change
* if they are already on the module path, +
nothing changes
* otherwise move them there
* check their dependencies


=== Inside-Out Migration

What about *published* projects *with* +
unmodularized dependencies +
(libraries)?

* top-down mostly works
* but there's an important detail +
about automatic module names!


=== Inside-Out Migration

++++
<h3>Automatic Module Names</h3>
++++

* automatic module name may +
be based on JAR name
* file names can differ +
across build environments
* module name can change +
when project gets modularized

⇝ Such automatic module names are unstable.


=== Inside-Out Migration

++++
<h3>Impossible Module Requirements</h3>
++++

* dependencies might require the same +
module by different names
* the module system does not support that
* there is no way to launch that application!

⇝ *Do not publish* modules +
that depend on automatic modules +
whose names are *based on file names*!


=== Inside-Out Migration

++++
<h3>Manifest Entry</h3>
++++

* thanks to manifest entry projects +
can already publish their module name
* assumption is that it won't change +
when project gets modularized
* that makes these names stable

⇝ It is *ok to publish* modules +
that depend on automatic modules +
whose names are *based on manifest entry*.
