== Migration Challenges

++++
<h3>What to look out for<br>when running on JDK 9</h3>
++++


=== Break Stuff
image::images/broken-glass.jpg[background, size=cover]

Some internal changes https://blog.codefx.org/java/java-9-migration-guide/[break existing code]!

Just by running on JDK 11 +
(even without modularizing the application).

// http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261[JEP 261] contains a list of risks.


=== Internal APIs
image::images/internals.jpg[background, size=cover]

* internal APIs are:
** all in `sun.*`
** most in `com.sun.*` +
(unless marked `@jdk.Exported`)
* encapsulated at compile time
* accessible at run time +
for some time
* critical APIs may survive longer +
(e.g. `sun.misc.Unsafe`)


=== What to look for?

https://blog.codefx.org/tools/jdeps-tutorial-analyze-java-project-dependencies/[JDeps] can report internal dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
$ jdeps --jdk-internals
	-recursive --class-path 'libs/*'
	scaffold-hunter-2.6.3.jar

> batik-codec.jar -> JDK removed internal API
>     JPEGImageWriter -> JPEGCodec
> guava-18.0.jar -> jdk.unsupported
>     Striped64 -> Unsafe
> scaffold-hunter-2.6.3.jar -> java.desktop
>     SteppedComboBox -> WindowsComboBoxUI
----


=== What else to look for?

* look for reflection, especially
** `Class::forName`
** `AccessibleObject::setAccessible`
* recursively check your dependencies!


=== What to do?

. fix your code
. contact library developers
. look for alternatives +
(in the JDK or other libraries)
. consider command line flags +
`--add-exports`, `--add-opens`, or +
`--illegal-access`


=== Java EE Modules
image::images/java-ee.jpg[background, size=cover]

* _java.activation_ (`javax.activation`)
* _java.corba_ (CORBA packages)
* _java.transaction_ (`javax.transaction`)
* _java.xml.bind_ (`javax.xml.bind.*`)
* _java.xml.ws_ (JAX-WS packages)
* _java.xml.ws.annotation_ (`javax.annotation`)

These were

* deprecated for removal in ⑨
* removed in ⑪


=== What to look for?

JDeps shows dependencies on platform modules:

[source,bash]
----
$ jdeps -summary sh-2.6.3.jar

> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.base
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.datatransfer
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.desktop
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.logging
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.prefs
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.sql
> sh-2.6.3.jar -> java.xml
----


=== What to do?

Pick https://stackoverflow.com/a/48204154/2525313[a third-party implementation].


=== Split Packages
image::images/cut.jpg[background, size=cover]

* packages should have a unique origin
* no module must read the same package +
from two modules

The implementation is even stricter:

* no two modules must contain +
the same package (exported or not)
* split packages on class path +
are inaccessible


=== Examples

* some libraries split `java.xml.*`, e.g. http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|xml-apis|xml-apis|2.0.2|jar[xml-apis]
* some https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-6375?_sscc=t[JBoss modules] split, e.g., +
`java.transaction`, `java.xml.ws`
* http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305[jsr305] splits `javax.annotation`


=== What to look for?

JDeps reports split packages:

[source,bash]
----
$ jdeps -summary
	-recursive --class-path 'libs/*'
	project.jar

> split package: javax.annotation
>     [jrt:/java.xml.ws.annotation,
>         libs/jsr305-3.0.2.jar]
----


=== What to do?

Your artifacts:

. rename one of the packages
. merge package into the same artifact
. merge the artifacts
. place both artifacts on the class path

Otherwise:

[start=5]
. upgrade the JDK module with the artifact
. `--patch-module` with the artifact's content


=== Run-Time Images
image::images/cells.jpg[background, size=cover]

* new JDK/JRE layout
* internal JARs are gone (e.g. `rt.jar`, `tools.jar`)
* JARs are now JMODs
* application class loader is no `URLClassLoader` +
(no way to append to its class path)
* new URL schema for run-time image content


=== What to look for?

* does the code rummage around +
in the JDK / JRE folder?
* are URLs to JDK classes / resources handcrafted?
* search for casts to `URLClassLoader`


=== Obsolete
image::images/obsolete.jpg[background, size=cover]

* Compact Profiles
* Extension Mechanism
* Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
* Boot Class Path Override
* JRE version selection with `-version:N`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* ext. mech.: makes custom APIs available to all applications running on the JDK
* first 2 replaced by upgradeable modules.

=== But wait, there's more!

Yes, yes, there's more:

*Java 9 Migration Guide* +
(https://blog.codefx.org/java/java-9-migration-guide/[tiny.cc/java-9-migration])

Background:

* https://blog.codefx.org/java/planning-your-java-9-update/[Planning Your Java 9 Update]
* https://blog.codefx.org/java/five-command-line-options-to-hack-the-java-9-module-system/[JPMS Command Line Options]
* https://blog.codefx.org/tools/jdeps-tutorial-analyze-java-project-dependencies/[JDeps Tutorial]

And there are new version strings:

* goodbye `1.9.0_31`, hello `9.0.1` +


=== General Advice I
image::images/sign.jpg[background, size=cover]

The most relevant for most applications:

* internal APIs
* split packages
* Java EE modules


=== General Advice II
image::images/sign.jpg[background, size=cover]

* get your code in shape +
(and prevent relapses)
* check your dependencies and tools
* if any are suspicious +
(automatically true for IDEs, build tools):
** make sure they're alive
** *get them up to date!*
** or look for alternatives
* download Java 11 and *try it!*
