=== Break Stuff

Some internal changes can
http://blog.codefx.org/java/dev/how-java-9-and-project-jigsaw-may-break-your-code/[break existing code]!

Just by running on JDK 9 +
(even without modularizing the application).

http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261[JEP 261] contains a list of risks.


=== Internal APIs
image::images/internals.jpg[background, size=cover]

* internal APIs are:
** all in `sun.*`
** most in `com.sun.*` +
(unless marked `@jdk.Exported`)
* most if them are encapsulated
* critical APIs will survive until Java 10 +
(e.g. `sun.misc.Unsafe` -- see http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/260[JEP 260])
* six deprecated methods adding/removing +
`PropertyChangeListener` got removed +
from `LogManager` and `Pack200`


=== What to look for?

* use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jdeps.html[`jdeps`] (preferably from JDK 9)
** either manually: +
`jdeps --jdk-internals {*.class/*.jar}`
** or as part of your build (e.g. with https://github.com/CodeFX-org/JDeps-Maven-Plugin[JDeps Mvn])
* look for reflection, especially
** `Class::forName`
** `AccessibleObject::setAccessible`
* recursively check your dependencies!


=== What to do?

. contact library developers
. look for alternatives +
(in the JDK or other libraries)
. consider command line flags +
`--add-exports`, `--add-opens`, or +
`--permit-illegal-access`


=== Split Packages
image::images/cut.jpg[background, size=cover]

* packages should have a unique origin
* no module must read the same package +
from two modules

The implementation is even stricter:

* no two modules must contain +
the same package (exported or not)
* split packages on class path +
are inaccessible


=== Examples

* some libraries split `java.xml.*`, e.g. http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|xml-apis|xml-apis|2.0.2|jar[xml-apis]
* some https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-6375?_sscc=t[JBoss modules] split, e.g., +
`java.transaction`, `java.xml.ws`
* http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.findbugs/jsr305[jsr305] splits `javax.annotation`


=== What to look for?

* search your code and dependencies +
for `java(x)` packages (`jdeps` can help)
[[TODO, add Maven enforcer rule ban-duplicate-classes]]
* no tool support (http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2015-November/005227.html[yet?])


=== What to do?

. is the split on purpose / necessary?
. find other ways to solve the problem
. upgradeable modules +
to replace run-time modules
. command line `--patch-module` +
to add individual classes

=== Run-Time Images
image::images/cells.jpg[background, size=cover]

* new JDK/JRE layout
* internal JARs are gone (e.g. `rt.jar`, `tools.jar`)
* JARs are now JMODs
* application class loader is no `URLClassLoader`
* new URL schema for run-time image content


=== What to look for?

* does the code rummage around +
in the JDK / JRE folder?
* search for casts to `URLClassLoader`
* are URLs to JDK classes / resources handcrafted?


=== Obsolete
image::images/obsolete.jpg[background, size=cover]

* Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
* Extension Mechanism
* Boot Class Path Override

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* ext. mech.: makes custom APIs available to all applications running on the JDK
* first 2 replaced by upgradeable modules.
--


=== But wait, there's more!

* yes, yes, there's more
* you should really check http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261[JEP 261]
* and http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223[JEP 223] (new version strings)
** goodbye `1.9.0_31`
** hello `9.1.4`


=== General Advice I
image::images/sign.jpg[background, size=cover]

The most relevant for most applications:

* internal APIs
* split packages


=== General Advice II
image::images/sign.jpg[background, size=cover]

* get your code in shape +
(and prevent relapses)
* check your dependencies and tools
* if any are suspicious +
(automatically true for IDEs, build tools):
** make sure they're alive
** *get them up to date!*
** or look for alternatives
* get an https://jdk9.java.net/[EA-build] and *try it!*
