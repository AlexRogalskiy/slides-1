=== Setting up a blog

There are two common ways +
to set up a blog:

* content management system +
  (CMS, e.g. https://wordpress.org/[WordPress])
* static site generator +
  (e.g. https://jekyllrb.com/[Jekyll] or https://www.gatsbyjs.org/[GatsbyJS])

=== Content Management Systems

Properties:

* dynamic, powerful, complex, slow (1-2s)
* often cluttered
* have on-board/plugin support for +
  comments, user accounts, paywalls, etc.
* editing happens in a dedicated web component
* versioning and collaboration suck

=== Static Site Generators

* can only serve static content, fast (0.1-0.2s)
* often very clean themes
* user interaction (e.g. comments) +
  must be provided by outside services
* can be written offline in sensible format +
  (usually https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[AsciiDoc])
* use established tools for +
  versions, collaboration, and deployment +
  (GitHub, GitLab, Travis, etc.)

=== CMS vs Static

Stand-off:

* for a good reading/writing experience +
  prefer static site generators
* if there's a lot of dynamic content +
  beyond comments, use a CMS

=== URL structure

Keep URLs simple:

* no date
* no category structure: +
https://blog.codefx.org/java/java-11-migration-guide/[blog.codefx.org/java/java-11-migration-guide]
// ðŸ¤”

Makes them easier to read and share.

=== Bells and whistles

Start simple:

* no comments
* no dynamic content

But:

* minimal SEO
* social media integration +
  (buttons and HTML tags)
