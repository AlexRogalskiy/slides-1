=== Interaction is low

Expect ~ 0.1% interaction:

* comments
* follows
* subscription
* etc.

⇝ Activate comments once you have +
a few hundred daily readers.

=== Traffic sources

*Google is king!*

Only first page counts.

=== Common-sense SEO

Narrow each post's topic down +
to one to three *keywords*.

Then mention keywords in:

* URL / title
* search engine description / +
  social media tags
* first paragraph
* headers if suitable
* text

*Don't spam!*

=== Social media

Social media plays an important role:

* drives some traffic
* spreads the content, +
  so other people can link to it

More details ⇝ later.

=== Content strategy

_Target entry-level topics._

* large target audience
* easier to write
* lots of competition
* interaction more shallow

=== Content strategy

_Target advanced topics._

* small target audience
* easier to get high ranking
* require skills and research
* richer interaction with readers
* good brand

=== Content strategy

_Target new topics ASAP._

* potentially large audience
* easier to get high ranking
* requires research
* runs the risk of getting dated
* good brand

=== Grow traffic

To grow traffic, make content +
easy to find/navigate:

* mention involved libraries/tools
* include long/full error messages
* cross-link content

=== Grow traffic

All of this only works, if:

* content is good
* delivery is constant

Then, readers will come.

=== Grow traffic

That was https://vladmihalcea.com/ by Vlad Mihalcea.

But:

* he averaged more than one post per week
* for more than five years
* on one topic (Hibernate)
* as an expert

That's not the norm! +
(⇝ Survivor bias.)

=== Traffic isn't everything

Remember, you're also building a brand! +
(Yours & Accenture's)

* potential applicants may read the blog
* potential customers may read the blog

Keep it classy.

If in doubt, prefer +
higher quality over higher traffic.
