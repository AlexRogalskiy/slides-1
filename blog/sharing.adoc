=== Make sharing convenient

Make it easy for people +
to share your content:

* offer "Share" functionality on your site
* consider a permissive license for text +
  (CC-BY / NC / SA)
* consider a permissive license for code +
  (e.g. MIT)

=== Sharing

Social media is a good way to...

* reach applicants/customers
* build a brand
* seed links
* waste time

=== Platforms

My take on platforms:

* Google+ shuts down
* everybody hates LinkedIn
* nobody uses Facebook for tech

⇝ Use Twitter.

=== Twitter

As with traffic:

* first nobody cares
* need to build an audience

=== Twitter

Building an audience:

* dedicated account +
  to address developers
* share other people's good content
* @mention them!
* do it regularly +
  (you can schedule tweets)

=== Twitter

Publish your content:

* tweet when it's new
* best time is 8am-12am
* occasionally tweet +
  "from the archives"

=== Beyond Twitter

Java has a rich community:

* many people write regular newsletters +
  ⇝ ask them kindly to include your content
* Reddit and HackerNews can have big effects +
  (careful with community guidelines!)
* consider syndication

=== Syndication

Sites like JavaCodeGeeks, DZone, ...

* republish your content on their site
* credit you as the author
* steal your search engine traffic

Loss of traffic can be ok for a company blog.

=== Syndication

For syndication, prefer posts that:

* will not rank well on Google
* contain lots of links to your site

Add to that trade-off between +
traffic and brand-building.
