=== Old release cadence
==== The plan

* releases are driven by flagship features
* new major release roughly every 2 years

=== Old release cadence
==== The reality

* Java 7 took 5 years
* Java 8 took 3 years
* Java 9 took 3.5 years

"Bump an 'almost ready' feature +
2+ years into the future?"

*⇝ "Better to delay the release."*

=== Downsides

* implemented features provide no value
* increases reaction time
* puts (political) pressure on projects
* makes everybody grumpy

=== The new world

> If it hurts, do it more often.

* fixed six-month release cadence +
(March and September)
* ship everything that is ready

All are major releases +
with known quality guarantees.

⇝ No "beta versions"!

=== Implementation

[%step]
* features are developed in "branches"
* merged into "master" when (nearly) finished
* "release branch" created 3 months prior
* only bug fixes merged to "release branch"

=== Upsides

* completed features get out earlier
* no pressure to complete features on time
* easier to incubate features
* easier to react to changes in the ecosystem

=== Release fatigue?

"Java will change too fast."

"Constant migrations will be expensive."

"Test matrix will explode."

"Ecosystem will fragment."

=== Fast Change

Maybe speed will pick up a little:

* recent activities target low-hanging fruits
* Oracle is focusing on Java core (my impression!)

=== Fast Change

By and large:

*Evolution will be _steadier_, not _faster_.*

(see Java 11)

=== Expensive migrations

Yes, https://blog.codefx.org/java/java-9-migration-guide/#fixes-2[Java 9  migration is tough]!

But not the norm:

* Java 10 is trivial
* Java 11 is easy

Oracle is still committed +
to backwards compatibility!

=== Expensive migrations

Balance shifted between +
*compatibility vs evolution*:

* `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`
* "one major release" is now 6 months, not 36
* increasing bytecode level
* incubating features (if used incorrectly)

=== Expensive migrations

Remedies:

* stick to supported APIs
* stick to standardized behavior
* stick to well-maintained projects
* keep dependencies and tools up to date
* consider using `jlink`

////
=== JLink can help

Use `jlink` to create application images:

* contain just the platform modules you need
* contain your code and your dependencies
* launch with `image/bin/your-app`

Single deployment unit, +
independent of installed JRE.

=== JLink considerations

Independent of installed JRE:

* no compatibility issues
* no automatic performance gain
* no automatic security updates

Works great if you have +
*complete control* +
over the deployment.

Not so much if you deliver software.
////

=== Exploding test matrix

As the range of supported versions increases...

* builds need to run against all of them
* developers need to switch between them

Many tools already support this. +
*⇝ We need to know how.*

Also: Moar automization!

=== Fragmenting Ecosystem

"This will be like Python 2/3!"

No.

=== Advice

* find a suitable update cadence
* build on each release (including EA)
* report problems
* only rely on standardized behavior
* heed deprecation warnings (`jdeprscan`)
* keep dependencies and tools up to date

Most importantly: +
*Be aware of what's coming!*

=== Be aware

Don't focus on versions!

*Focus on projects and JEPs:*

* large features are developed by http://openjdk.java.net/projects/[projects]
* smaller features are proposed by http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/0[JEP] only

Let's have a look at what's coming!
