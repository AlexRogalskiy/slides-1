== Long-term support

What if you (or your customers) +
don't want to update every six months?

=== Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK

Sun/Oracle JDK used to...

* contain more features
* be perceived as more stable
* be perceived as more performant

As of Java 11, on a technical basis, +
*Oracle JDK and OpenJDK are identical*.
https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/oracle-jdk-releases-for-java-11-and-later[*]

=== Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK

Only difference is license and support model:

* Oracle ships *OpenJDK* at http://jdk.java.net[jdk.java.net], +
licensed under GPL+CE
* *Oracle JDK* is fully commercial: +
from 11 on, no free use in production

*⇝ OpenJDK is the new normal!*

=== Oracle support

What does Oracle support?

* free updates for current *OpenJDK* version +
(i.e. six months)
* commercial support for *Oracle JDK* +
for 5+ years for Java 11, 17, 23, etc. +
(called https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription.html[_Java SE Subscription_];
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/javasesubscription-data-sheet-4891969.pdf[prices])

⇝ No free LTS by Oracle.

=== Oracle support

How does *Oracle* handle bug/security/etc fixes?

* usually developed on "master" (*OpenJDK*)
* merged to current version's "branch" (*OpenJDK*)
* merged to current LTS version (*Oracle JDK*)

⇝ "LTS" means merging fixes +
into old JDK versions.

=== Commercial LTS

* https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription.html[Oracle]
* https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/support/lifecycle/[IBM]
* https://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013[RedHat]
* https://www.azul.com/products/azul_support_roadmap/[Azul]
* ...

=== Free LTS

Current http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2018-August/001823.html[discussions] give hope:

* free LTS for *OpenJDK* 11, 17, 23, etc. +
  by the community for 4+ years
* built and shipped  by https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Adopt OpenJDK]

=== Free LTS

[L]et me assure you of one thing: whether by Oracle or Red Hat or someone else, JDK LTS releases will continue to be supported.
We all have a lot invested in Java, and we won't let it fall.
