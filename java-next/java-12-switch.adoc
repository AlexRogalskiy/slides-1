=== Preview Feature

*Note*:

In Java 12, switch expressions are +
a http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12[preview language feature]!

* must be enabled with `--enable-preview` +
  (on `javac` and `java`).
* in IntelliJ 2018.3 or later, +
  set the module's language level to +
  _12 (Preview) - Switch expressions_

=== Switch Expression

```java
int numLetters = switch (day) {
	case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
	case TUESDAY -> 7;
	case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> 8;
	case WEDNESDAY -> 9;
};
```

Two things to note:

* `switch` "has a result" +
  ⇝ it's an _expression_, not a _statement_
* lambda-style arrow syntax

=== Expression vs Statement

Statement:

```java
if (condition)
    result = doThis();
else
    result = doThat();
```

Expression:

```java
result = condition
	? doThis()
	: doThat();
```

=== Expression vs Statement

Statement:

* imperative construct
* guides computation, but has no result

Expression:

* is computed to a result

=== Expression vs Statement

For `switch`:

* if used with an assignment, +
  `switch` becomes an expression
* if used "stand-alone", it's +
  treated as a statement

This results in different behavior.

=== Arrow vs Colon

You can use `:` and `\->` with +
expressions and statements, e.g.:

```java
int numLetters = switch (day) {
	case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY: break 6;
	case TUESDAY: break 7;
	case THURSDAY, SATURDAY: break 8;
	case WEDNESDAY: break 9;
};
```

* `switch` is used as an expression
* `break result` returns `result`

=== Arrow vs Colon

Whether you use arrow or colon +
results in different behavior.

=== Switch Evolution

* general improvements
** multiple case labels
* specifics of arrow form
** no fall-through
** statement blocks
* specifics of expressions
** poly expression
** returning early
** exhaustiveness
