=== Motivation
image::images/valhalla.jpg[background, size=cover]

In Java, (almost) everything is a class:

* mutable by default
* memory access indirection
* requires extra memory for header
* allows locking and other +
identity-based operations

Wouldn't it be nice to create a custom `int`?

=== Value types

> Codes like a class, works like an `int`.

[source,java]
----
public value Point {

	public final int x;
	public final int y;

	public Point(int x, int y) {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}

}

	public final int y;

}

Yeah:

* enforced immutability
* no memory indirection!
* no `Object` header
* identity doesn't matter
* makes Java more expressive (think DDD)

=== Generic specialization

When everybody creates their own primitives, +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

[source,java]
----
List<int> ids = new ArrayList<>();

Yeah:

* backed by an actual `int[]`
* great performance
* works with your value types

=== Generic specialization

Has immense effect inside the JDK!

* no more manual specializations:
** functional interfaces
** stream API
** `Optional` API
* better performance

Has immense effect on your code!

* less trade-offs between +
design and performance
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs
