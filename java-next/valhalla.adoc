* launched July 2014, very active

=== Motivation
image::images/valhalla.jpg[background, size=cover]

In Java, (almost) everything is a class:

* mutable by default
* memory access indirection
* requires extra memory for header
* allows locking and other +
identity-based operations

Wouldn't it be nice to create a custom `int`?

=== Value types
image::images/valhalla.jpg[background, size=cover]

[source,java]
----
public value Point {

	private final int x;
	private final int y;

	// constructor, accessors,
	// equals/hashCode/toString,
	// and other methods

}
----

> Codes like a class, works like an `int`.

*Yeah:*

* enforced immutability
* no memory indirection! (_flat_)
* no `Object` header (_dense_)
* identity doesn't matter
* makes Java more expressive

=== Values vs Data Classes

*Values:*

* no identity
* no self references
* no mutability

⇝ flat and dense memory layout

*Data Classes:*

* no encapsulation

⇝ less boilerplate

Might be combinable to "data value types".

=== Generic specialization

When everybody creates their own primitives, +
boxing becomes omni-present and very painful!

[source,java]
----
List<int> ids = new ArrayList<>();

*Yeah:*

* backed by an actual `int[]`
* great performance
* works with your value types

=== Put together
image::images/valhalla.jpg[background, size=cover]

Value types and generic specialization together, +
have immense effects inside the JDK!

* no more manual specializations:
** functional interfaces
** stream API
** `Optional` API
* better performance

Value types and generic specialization together, +
have immense effects on your code!

* fewer trade-offs between +
design and performance
* better performance
* can express design more clearly
* more robust APIs
