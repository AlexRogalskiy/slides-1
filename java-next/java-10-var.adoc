=== Local-Variable Type Inference
==== Less typing, but still strongly typed

=== Type Duplication

We're used to duplicating +
type information:

```java
URL codefx = new URL("http://codefx.org");
URLConnection connection = codefx.openConnection();
Reader reader = new BufferedReader(
	new InputStreamReader(
		connection.getInputStream()));
```

Not so bad?

=== Type Duplication

What about this?

```java
No no = new No();
AmountIncrease<BigDecimal> more =
	new BigDecimalAmountIncrease();
HorizontalConnection<LinePosition, LinePosition>
	jumping =
		new HorizontalLinePositionConnection();
Variable variable = new Constant(5);
List<String> names = List.of("Max", "Maria");
```

=== Type Deduplication

Can't somebody else do that? +
Compiler knows the types!

Enter `var`:

```java
var codefx = new URL("http://codefx.org");
var connection = codefx.openConnection();
var reader = new BufferedReader(
	new InputStreamReader(
		connection.getInputStream()));
```

=== Rules of `var`

`var` only works in limited scopes:

[%step]
* compiler infers type from right-hand side +
  ⇝ rhs has to *exist* and *define a type*
* only works for local variables, `for`, `try` +
  ⇝ no `var` on fields or in method signatures
* also on lambda parameters ⑪ +
  ⇝ annotate inferred type on lambda parameters

=== Rules of `var`

Two more:

* not a keyword, but a _reserved type name_ +
  ⇝ variables/fields can be named `var`
* compiler writes type into bytecode +
  ⇝ no run-time component

=== What About Readability?

This *is* about readability!

* less redundancy
* more intermediate variables
* more focus on variable names
* aligned variable names

=== Aligned Variable Names

```java
var no = new No();
var more = new BigDecimalAmountIncrease();
var jumping = new HorizontalLinePositionConnection();
var variable = new Constant(5);
var names = List.of("Max", "Maria");
```

=== What About Readability?

Still think omitting types is always bad?

Ever wrote a lambda without declaring types?

```java
rhetoricalQuestion.answer(yes -> "see my point?");
```
