Enabling reuse between default methods.

=== No Reuse

```java
public interface InJava8 {

	default boolean evenSum(int... numbers) {
		return sum(numbers) % 2 == 0;
	}

	default boolean oddSum(int... numbers) {
		return sum(numbers) % 2 == 1;
	}

	default int sum(int[] numbers) {
		return IntStream.of(numbers).sum();
	}

}
```

=== Private Interface Methods

```java
public interface InJava9 {

	private int sum(int[] numbers) {
		return IntStream.of(numbers).sum();
	}

}
```

Just like private methods in abstract classes:

* must be implemented
* can not be overriden
* can only be called in same source file

Making `try`-with-resources blocks cleaner.

=== Useless Variable

```java
void doSomethingWith(Connection connection)
		throws Exception {
	try(Connection c = connection) {
		c.doSomething();
	}
}
```

Why is `c` necessary?

=== Why is `c` necessary?

* target of `close()` must be obvious +
‚áù resource should not be reassigned
* easiest if resource is final
* easiest if resource must be assigned +
and can be made implicitly final

```java
try(Connection c = connection)
```

=== Effectively Final Resource

But since Java 8 we have _effectively final_!

```java
void doSomethingWith(Connection connection)
		throws Exception {
	try(connection) {
		connection.doSomething();
	}
}

```

* compiler knows that `connection` is not reassigned
* developers know what _effectively final_ means
