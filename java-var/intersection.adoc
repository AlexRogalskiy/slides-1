=== Motivation

Sometimes you need a type +
that implements two interfaces +
without creating a new interface.

*For example:*

You need something +
that is `Closeable` and an `Iterator` +
without creating `CloseableIterator`.

=== Intersection types

Given two types, the *intersection type* +
is the set of variables that are of both types.

An intersection type has the API of both types!

*For example:*

A variable of type `Closeable & Iterator<E>` +
is both `Closeable` and an `Iterator<E>`.

It has `close()` and `hashNext()`/`next()`

=== Code

=== Intersection types

. in method signatures, express with generics:
+
```java
public <T extends Closeable & Iterator<String>>
	T createCloseableIterator(...) { ... }

public <E, T extends Closeable & Iterator<E>>
	E firstMatch(T elements, ...) { ... }
```
. for variables use `var`:
+
```java
var elements = createCloseableIterator(true);
firstMatch(elements, ...);
```

=== Evaluation

Downsides:

* combination of non-trivial Java features:
** generics with bounded wildcards
** type inference
* refactoring becomes harder

But:

* intersection types are known concept
* can be really helpful in a bind

*Add to tool box; use with care.*
