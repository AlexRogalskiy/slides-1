Talk that explains why certain features are the way they are:

* null-safe member selection operator ?.
	~> https://nipafx.dev/why-elvis-should-not-visit-java/
* immutable collections
	~> https://nipafx.dev/immutable-collections-in-java/
* streams and exceptions
	~> lazy evaluation and limited generics
* Optional as Monad
	~> requires `null` handling in `map`/`flatMap`
* add fields to records
	~> records are a semantic entity
	~> thanks to "state = API", they also work well with serialization and deconstruction patterns
* remove semicolons
	~> multi-language-expert-years project ~> aren't there better things to do
	~> lets to lots of churn and discussions without much value

"not a bad feature" is not enough
	~> takes time +> priorities
	~> there must a good migration path from a world without to a world with that feature

Extension methods: yes, there are numerous arguments why we considered and rejected them, including:

    API owners should own their APIs.  Extension methods undermine that.
    APIs have documentation.  A code reader should be able to look at a call foo.bar() and discover, given only the static type of foo, the specification for the bar() method being called.  Extension methods undermine that.
    Discoverability.  An author should be able to look at the specifcation for Foo and discover what methods they can call on it.  Extension methods undermine that.
    Transparency.  If the meaning of foo.bar() is contextual, then foo.bar() in two different places may mean two different things.  This creates sharp edges for refactoring.
    Traditional use-site extension methods are static, which means they have all the defects of static methods.

Essentially, extension methods undermine the core values of the platform -- readability, specification, discoverability, transparency -- for the sake of "I would rather write foo.bar() instead of bar(foo) .  What a terrible tradeoff.
