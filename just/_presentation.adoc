Talk that explains why certain features are the way they are:

* nullable types

 the challenge here is a lot like generics, but worse.  Nullable types in the type system is "easy", but there are two problems: (a) the zillions of lines of Java libraries out there would have to be treated as "raw" with respect to nullability, until every use of X is replaced by X! or X?, which could be decades.  And (b) people would find this intrusive.

<nd at the boundary between strict and loose code, you'd get warnings.
Which means users would be flooded with warnings all the time.
Like many forms of improved type checking, nullable types is one of those things you can do at the beginning, but is very hard to graft onto an existing ecosystem.

* Optional as Monad
	~> requires `null` handling in `map`/`flatMap`
* add fields to records
	~> records are a semantic entity
	~> thanks to "state = API", they also work well with serialization and deconstruction patterns
* remove semicolons
	~> multi-language-expert-years project ~> aren't there better things to do
	~> lets to lots of churn and discussions without much value

"not a bad feature" is not enough
	~> takes time +> priorities
	~> there must a good migration path from a world without to a world with that feature

Extension methods: yes, there are numerous arguments why we considered and rejected them, including:

    API owners should own their APIs.  Extension methods undermine that.
    APIs have documentation.  A code reader should be able to look at a call foo.bar() and discover, given only the static type of foo, the specification for the bar() method being called.  Extension methods undermine that.
    Discoverability.  An author should be able to look at the specifcation for Foo and discover what methods they can call on it.  Extension methods undermine that.
    Transparency.  If the meaning of foo.bar() is contextual, then foo.bar() in two different places may mean two different things.  This creates sharp edges for refactoring.
    Traditional use-site extension methods are static, which means they have all the defects of static methods.

Essentially, extension methods undermine the core values of the platform -- readability, specification, discoverability, transparency -- for the sake of "I would rather write foo.bar() instead of bar(foo) .  What a terrible tradeoff.
