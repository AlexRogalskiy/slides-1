== Summary

"Not a bad feature" is not enough!

* not every problem needs an immediate solution +
  (particularly not if it prevents a better one later)
* not every proposal is a solution +
  just because it works in other languages
* not every solution can be prioritized
* not every solution can be retrofitted
* not every retrofit may be worth it +
  (particularly if it splits the ecosystem)
