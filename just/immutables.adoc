=== What We Want

Immutable collections:

* interfaces without mutating methods _and_
* a guarantee that no mutations occur

As opposed to unmodifiable collections:

* interfaces without mutating methods _or_
* mutating methods that throw exceptions


=== Let's think this through

(On the example of lists.)

Assume we had `ImmutableList`:

* like `List` today
* but without any mutation

‚áù How is it related to `List`?

=== ImmutableList super List

Good:

* `ImmutableList` has no mutating methods

=== ImmutableList super List

Bad:

[source,java]
----
List<Agent> agents = new ArrayList<>();
// compiles because `List` extends `ImmutableList`
ImmutableList<Agent> section4 = agents;
// prints nothing
section4.forEach(System.out::println);

// now lets mutate `section4`
agents.add(new Agent("Motoko"));
// prints "Motoko" - how did she get in here?!
section4.forEach(System.out::println);
----

=== List super ImmutableList

image::images/immutable-collections-immutable-extends-mutable.png[role="diagram"]

Good:

* `ImmutableList` isn't extended +
  and thus actually immutable

=== List super ImmutableList

Bad:

* `ImmutableList` has mutating methods that throw
* `ImmutableList` can be passed as `List` +
  ‚áù it's reasonable to assume that mutation is allowed +
  ‚áù runtime exceptions

Only really work well locally, +
i.e. not across API boundaries.

=== Immutability as Absence

Easy to mistake immutability as an absence:

* take a `List`
* remove mutating methods
* profit

No!

That just gives you `UnmodifiableList`!

=== Immutability as a Feature

An `UnmodifiableList` offers no mutating methods, +
without making immutability guarantees.

There are two things to add:

* make it mutable by adding the according methods
* make it immutable by adding the according guarantees

=== (Im)Mutability Clash

[quote,Your's truly]
____
Immutability is not an absence of mutation, it's a guarantee there won't be mutation
____

(Im)mutability is inherited by subtypes!

If one of two types extends the other, +
one of them contains both properties. +
‚áù üí£

=== How to make this work

Solution:

* don't make the two lists inherit one another
* instead, have a new supertype for both

=== In Practice

[source,java]
----
interface SecretService {

	void payAgents(UnmodifiableList<Agent> agents);
	void sendOnMission(ImmutableList<Agent> agents);
	void downtime(List<Agent> agents);

	UnmodifiableList<Agent> teamRoster();
	ImmutableList<Agent> teamOnMission();
	List<Agent> team();

}
----

=== In Practice

But such code already exists +
and often looks like this:

[source,java]
----
interface SecretService {

	void payAgents(List<Agent> agents);
	void sendOnMission(List<Agent> agents);
	void downtime(List<Agent> agents);

	List<Agent> teamRoster();
	List<Agent> teamOnMission();
	List<Agent> team();

}
----

=== Retrofit new hierarchy

To benefit from new types, +
we need to use them (duh!), but:

* `List` to `ImmutableList` +
  is source-incompatible ‚áù rewrite
* return type `List` to `UnmodifiableList` +
  is source-incompatible ‚áù rewrite
* parameter type `List` to `UnmodifiableList` +
  is bytecode-incompatible ‚áù recompile

Imagine this for the JDK, +
all libraries, frameworks, and your code!

=== Retrofit new hierarchy

Alternative:

* duplicate existing methods +
  with a new name and new types
* deprecate old variants

Huge task that takes forever!

=== Summary

* immutable collection types are a great thing to have
* proper implementations of `List` and `ImmutableList` +
  can never extend one another
* this complicates their introduction into existing APIs
* requires rewriting and recompiling code +
  across the entire Java ecosystem

=== Higher-Level Summary

It doesn't make sense to introduce someting that:

* requires rewriting/recompiling the world
* splits the ecosystem into *old* and *new*

Just because something would be *nice to have* +
doesn't mean it's *nice to get*.
