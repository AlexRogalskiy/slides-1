== The benefits of comments

* explain what happens
* keep abstractions intact
* enable top-down learning
* document intent
* spur redesign
* save lives!

=== Explain what happens

[source,java]
----
// check whether user logged in
if (user.loggedInSince(date))
	// increase activeUserCount
	activeUserCount++;
----

=== Explain what happens

Duh!

* intrinsically redundant
* can cause confusion

May be helpful when using +
arcane language features.

=== Keep abstractions intact

[source,java]
----
public interface Map<K, V> {

	/**
	 * Associates the specified value
	 * with the specified key in this
	 * map (optional operation).
	 *
	 * [...]
	 */
	V put(K key, V value);

}
----

=== Keep abstractions intact

Every unit of code provides an abstraction:

* does one thing and does it well
* hides how it does it
* should not require  us +
to look past the abstraction

The core to modularizing any non-trivial problem!

=== Keep abstractions intact

Abstractions provide two benefits:

* reuse code
* reuse understanding

*Comments can help with both!*

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* abstractions lose value if I have to step into them
* tests, clean code, ... only shines then
* you have to build a new context
--

=== Top-down vs bottom-up

* most people learn better top-down
* clean code, tests, ... are bottom-up approaches

Comments can be *signposts*, +
helping to stay on +
the right *level of abstraction*.

=== Document intent

[source,java]
----
public class ArrayList<E> {

	// non-private to simplify nested class access
	transient Object[] elementData;

}
----

////
=== Document intent

Context is invaluable when revisiting code!

* why?
* no seriously, WHY?
* why the &*☠#?!

=== Document intent

Context is invaluable when revisiting code!

* other tools may contain this info
* working through them takes time
* and is transient!

*Comments can be 2nd line of defense.*

=== Spur redesign

[quote,Mike Bostok]
____
It’s funny how writing documentation can spur redesign: it’s easier to simplify a complex API than try to document it completely.

=== Spur redesign

If it takes a long time to...

* describe behavior on a high level
* cover all special cases
* explain rationale behind a decision

...maybe the code needs to be improved.

*You become your own reviewer!*

=== Safe lives

[quote,John F. Woods]
____
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.
