=== The Axiom

> Comments are always failures.

(Some guy with a book.)

He's wrong!


=== Self Documenting Code

I don't care about your code!

I want to know what happens when I use it!

* pre- & postconditions
* what return value can I expect?
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good names, small methods, SOLID, ... don't help here
* observed behavior != contract
* how many interface implementations am I supposed to check?
* what if I have to implement an interface?
* You're code is not a special snowflake - it's the all singing all dancing crap of the world.
* I am in a hurry and have to get shit done.
--


=== Tests

I care even less about your tests!

How do you test this?

* "for all" propositions
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* do you have tests for interfaces?
* test coverage better be > 90%.
--


=== Tests

Ever heard *RTFT*? +
(Read The &*â˜ # Tests) +


No?

What was I thinking about?


=== Comments Age

That's like saying +
"Car's crash".

So? Do we get rid of them?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* crashes are caused by negligence
* are often punishable by law
* do not harm the overall benefit
--


=== Comments Age

What about names?

* do they age?
* do you update them?

Yes?!

Then update the comments, too!
