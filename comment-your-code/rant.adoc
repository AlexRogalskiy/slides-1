=== The Axiom

[quote,Some guy with a book]
____
Comments are always failures.
____

He's wrong!

=== Self Documenting Code

*I don't care about your code!*

I'm in a hurry, +
what happens when I use it?

* pre- & postconditions
* return value range
* side-effects
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good names, small methods, SOLID, ... don't help here
* observed behavior != contract
* how many interface implementations am I supposed to check?
* what if I have to implement an interface?
* You're code is not a special snowflake - it's the all singing all dancing crap of the world.
* I am in a hurry and have to get shit done.
--

=== Self-documenting code

Let's say I care about the code +
(*which I don't!*)...

I have to change it, +
why does it look like this?

* considered alternatives
* code-shaping requirements
* overall architecture
* design principles

=== Tests

*I care even less about your tests!*

How do you test this?

* "for all" propositions
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability
* interfaces

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* do you have tests for interfaces?
* test coverage better be > 90%.
--

=== Tests

Ever heard *RTFT*? +
(Read The &*â˜ # Tests)

No?

What was I thinking about?

=== What we got so far...

Your clean code and tests *suck* for:

* quickly determining expected behavior
* understanding larger concepts
* conveying rationale for decisions

=== Comments are hard

[quote,Kevlin Henney]
____
A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensible code will somehow be able to express themselves lucidly and clearly in comments.
____

Schroedinger's developer...

* can write squeaky clean code
* can not write in their mother tongue

ðŸ¤”

=== Comments age

That's like saying +
"Car's crash".

So? Do we get rid of them?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* crashes are caused by negligence
* crashes are often punishable by law
* crashes are acceptable given the benefits
--

=== Comments age

What about names?

* do they age?
* do you update them?

Yes?!

Then update the comments, too!

* I'm a hipster, alternative insurance
* wanted a contract, but invited to hq:
** "working company over unread contracts" policy
** crisp org structure
** great architecture, good design
** attentive employees with great names
** call or visit customers
** given, when, then
* just send us money and we'll cover you
