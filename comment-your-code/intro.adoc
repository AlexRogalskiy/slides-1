=== The Axiom

[quote,Uncle Bob in "Clean Code"]
____
Comments are always failures.
____

He's wrong!

=== Self-documenting code

*I don't care about the code!*

I'm in a hurry, +
what happens when I use it?

* pre- & postconditions
* return value range
* side-effects
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability

=== Self-documenting code

I'm in a hurry!

* good names, small methods, SOLID, ... +
only go so far
* how many interface implementations +
am I supposed to check?
* what if I have to implement an interface?

=== Self-documenting code

*I care about the code!*

I have to change it, +
why does it look like this?

* considered alternatives
* code-shaping requirements
* overall architecture
* design principles

=== Self-documenting code

I have to change it!

* good names, small methods, ... +
are almost useless
* SOLID helps! 👍
* ubiquitous patterns help +
what about lesser known ones?

Still, most information +
not expressible in code!

=== Tests

*I care even less about the tests!*

How do you test this?

* "for all" propositions
* thread-safety
* (im)mutability
* interfaces

Test coverage better be > 90%!

=== Tests

Tests are observations:

* take time to generalize
* are _not_ a contract
* only explain _what_, never _why_

=== Tests

Ever heard *RTFT*? +
(Read The &*☠# Tests)

No?

What was I thinking about?

=== Interlude

Self-documenting code and tests are great for:

* understanding little pieces of code
* editing code

They are really bad for:

* quickly determining expected behavior
* understanding larger concepts
* conveying rationale for decisions

=== Comments are hard

[quote,Kevlin Henney]
____
A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensible code will somehow be able to express themselves lucidly and clearly in comments.

=== So is code...

[quote,Yours Truly]
____
A common fallacy is to assume developers incapable to express themselves lucidly and clearly in a natural language will somehow be able to write lucid and clean code.
____

=== Comments age

That's like saying +
"Car's crash".

So? Do we get rid of them?

Crashes:

* are caused by negligence
* are often punishable by law
* are acceptable given the benefits

=== Comments age

What about names?

* do they age?
* are they updated?

Yes?!

But comments can't be? 🤔
