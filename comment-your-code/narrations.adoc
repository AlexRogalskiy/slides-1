== What does it do?

```java
public int activeUserCountSince(Date date) {
	int activeUserCount = 0;
	// loop through the users
	for (User user : users)

		if (user.loggedInSince(date))
			// increase activeUserCount
			activeUserCount++;
	return activeUserCount;
}
```


=== Narrations

Usually inline comments.

* explain what the code does
* speak on a very technical level


=== Analysis

Currency::
* very high
* need to be absolutely up to date!
Proximity::
* right on the narrated line(s)
Alternatives::
* good names
* transparent design
* well-known patterns

=== Costs

// TODO, make all costs/benefits into diagrams

* *composition*: medium
* *maintenance*: high
* *confusion*: high risk
* *obstruction*: yes, can't be hidden


=== Benefits

* *explain what happens*: yes
* *keep abstractions intact*: no
* *top down over bottom up*: no
* *documenting intent*: a little


=== Verdict

> Narrations suck!

&nbsp;

With one exception:

* arcane language features are used
* there is no alternative
* there is no way to improve readability
