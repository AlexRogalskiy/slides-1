== The Costs Of Comments

or

+++<h2>Why Everybody Hates Comments</h2>+++


=== Initial Composition

Writing a comment is harder...

* ... the later it is done
* ... the more complex the code is
* ... the more precise the comment is

Usually affordable +
compared to writing code and tests.

--
* cost is capped when abstraction works well

=== Maintenance

What do to with comments +
when code changes?

* updating ⇝ takes time
* leaving unchanged ⇝ causes confusion
* deletion ⇝ wastes past efforts

Whatever schema you decide on +
*maintenance is critical*!


=== Maintenance

* *changing* comments takes little time
* but *finding* them can be hard

⇝ Comments and code must be close!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* pesky, time-consuming, error-prone
--


=== Confusion

Comments that are

* outdated
* ambiguous
* lacking detail

cause confusion!


=== Confusion

Costs are unpredictable +
but potentially enormous!

Deteriorates trust in comments.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good coding techniques reduce risk
--


=== Obstruction

Takes up screen space.

(Fold that shit!)


=== Why Everybody _Really_ Hates Comments

* they may be hard to write
* they turn nothing green
* nobody gets a pat on the back +
for a clever comment
