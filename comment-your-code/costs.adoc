+++<h2>Why Everybody Hates Comments</h2>+++

=== The Costs Of Comments

* initial composition
* maintenance
* confusion
* obstruction

=== Initial Composition

Writing a comment is harder...

* the later it is done
* the more complex the topic is
* the more precise the comment is

Usually affordable +
compared to writing code and tests.

=== Maintenance

What do to with comments +
when code changes?

* nothing ⇝ may cause confusion
* update ⇝ takes time
* delete ⇝ wastes past efforts

Whatever schema you decide on +
*maintenance is critical*!

=== Maintenance

* *changing* comments takes little time
* but *finding* them can be hard

⇝ Comments and code must be close!

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* pesky, time-consuming, error-prone
--

=== Confusion

Comments that are...

* outdated
* ambiguous
* lack detail

...cause confusion!

=== Confusion

Costs are unpredictable +
but potentially enormous!

Deteriorates trust in comments.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* good coding techniques reduce risk
--

=== Obstruction

Takes up screen space.

(Fold that shit!)

=== Why Everybody _Really_ Hates Comments

* they may be hard to write
* they turn nothing green
* nobody gets a pat on the back +
for a clever comment
