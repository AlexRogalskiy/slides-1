* reference external standards
* mention tools like Swagger and SpringRESTdocs in Contract Comments
* in Contract Comments, elaborate on "Writing and maintaining comments that fulfill this promise requires determination, an eye for detail, and unambiguous language."
* pick some of these http://stackoverflow.com/q/184618
* find the quote about the psycho knowing where you live
