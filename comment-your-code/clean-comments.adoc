== Where Does This Leave Us?

Let's move away from

> All comments are failures.

Instead

> Comments are a tool to facilitate understanding.
> We should use it wisely!

=== Clean Comments

For individual comments:

* make obvious which kind they are
* put yourself in your reader's mind
* strive for high locality
* get them reviewed

[NOTE.speaker]

* use phrases like "at the time of writing"
* use @apiNote, @implNote
* use different styles: /** vs /* vs //
--


=== Clean Comments

This is my proposal:

* avoid _narrations_ whenever possible
* always have a paragraph that explains +
a class's central abstraction
* add _contracts_ to reused APIs
* provide as much _context_ as possible


=== Clean Comments

But the details depend on many factors:

* team:
** size
** technical backgrounds
* code base:
** size
** heterogeneity
** ownership


=== Clean Comments

So:

* get the team together and +
speak *freely* about comments
* go through the code base and +
*discuss* concrete examples
* settle on a *shared approach* and +
include it in your style guide
* use pair programming or code reviews +
to *adapt and enforce*
