=== Comments are a tool

Let's move away from:

> All comments are failures.

Instead:

> Comments are a tool to facilitate understanding.
> We should use it wisely!

=== Clean comments

Write clean code and good tests. +
Then add *clean comments*:

* make obvious which kind they are
* strive for high proximity
* use unambiguous language
* consider API users _and_ maintainers

Get comments reviewed!

=== Clean narrations

What?

* avoid whenever possible
* strive for clean code

How?

* use line comments (`//` in Java)
* place directly on line

=== Clean contracts

What?

* describe _every_ top-level element's +
(class, interface, endpoint, etc.) +
central abstraction

From there on, it's up for debate:

* prefer stable elements
* prefer reused elements
* heed diminishing returns

=== Clean contracts

How many and how detailed +
depends on many factors:

* team:
** size ðŸ“ˆ
** technical backgrounds ðŸ“ˆ
** stability ðŸ“‰
* code base:
** size ðŸ“ˆ
** technologies ðŸ“ˆ
** ownership ðŸ“‰

=== Clean contracts

How?

* use tools
** for Java: proper http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-135444.html[JavaDoc] (`/** */`)
** for REST:
https://swagger.io/[Swagger] or
https://docs.spring.io/spring-restdocs/docs/current/reference/html5/[Spring REST Docs]
// (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWj-t69EdN4[introductory talk])
* promise results not steps +
(declarative, not imperative)
* promise only what is required _and_ tested

=== Clean technical context

What?

* non-trivial implementation
* trade-off between alternatives
* operational or developmental requirements

=== Clean technical context

How?

* look into http://blog.codefx.org/java/new-javadoc-tags/[`@apiNote` and `@implNote`]
* multi-line comments (`/* */`) +
at start of type or method
* strive for high-level description
* cite/link issues, wikis, etc.

=== Clean historical context

What?

* non-obvious requirements
* "temporary" solutions (and alternatives)

How?

* use phrases like _"at the time of writing"_
* multi-line comments (`/* */`)
* cite/link issues, wikis, etc.

=== Side note

Include non-source files:

* build tooling ("Why this version of Guava?")
* configurations ("Why does CI store artifacts?")
* documentation (yay, recursion!)
* etc.

=== Maintaining comments

What's impacted when you change code?

* surrounding class
* callers
* tests

Check comments on those elements! +
("Reverse-proximity")

=== Maintaining comments

Pair programming? Code reviews? +
Keep comments in mind!

(N.B., developers complaining of aging comments +
are usually the ones letting them age.)

=== Clean comments

Bottom line:

* avoid narrations
* describe central abstractions
* decide how many/detailed contracts
* always provide context

=== Clean comments

My recommendations:

* get the team together and +
*speak freely* about comments
* go through the code base and +
*discuss* concrete examples
* settle on a *shared approach* and +
include it in your style guide
* use pair programming or code reviews +
to *adapt and enforce*
