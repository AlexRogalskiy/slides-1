== Looking Closer...

* actuality
* locality
* alternatives


=== Actuality

* some comments need to be very up-to-date
* others can be slightly or even totally outdated

This influences costs:

* maintenance
* confusion


=== Locality

How far can a comment be away +
from what it describes?

* some must basically be on the same line +
to make any sense at all
* others might span several concepts +
so they can be some classes away

It is hard to update far-away comments!


=== Alternatives

There are plenty of alternatives to comments.

But not all work for everything.

* clean code
* tests, demos
* version control
* issue tracker
* wiki
