== Looking Closer...

* currency
* proximity
* alternatives

=== Currency

(No, not money; "up-to-dateness")

* some comments need to be very up-to-date
* others can be slightly or even totally outdated

This influences costs:

* maintenance
* confusion

=== Proximity

How far can a comment be away +
from what it describes?

* some must basically be on the same line
* others can be some classes away +
because they span several concepts

It is hard to update far-away comments!

=== Alternatives

There are plenty of alternatives to comments:

* clean code
* tests, demos
* version control
* issue tracker
* wiki

But not all work for every use case.
