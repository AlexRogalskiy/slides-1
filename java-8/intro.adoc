== Hello, Java 8

```java
() -> System.out.println("Hello, Java 8!")
```

* ask any question you have +
as soon as you have it
* ask your colleagues first
* there are no stupid questions!
* work in pairs or triples +
(+1 for mixing skill levels)
* consider taking notes

=== A Very Short History

Project Lambda started in 2010:

* language features:
** lambda expressions
** default methods
* library changes:
** stream API
** `Optional`
** various smaller changes

Java 8 shipped in March 2014.

=== Paradigm Shift

Lambdas make it easy to treat code as data.

* passing "functions" was always easy in Java: +
** use interface with single abstract method +
   (e.g. `Runnable`)
** pass instance of it
* creating "functions" becomes really easy now:
+
```java
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
```

=== Paradigm Shift

Makes it easier to parameterize behavior:

* by _passing_ an action
* instead of _configuring_ it

There are many other additions in Java 8, +
but we don't have time for them.
